# Loan Default Risk Prediction: Capstone Project with Machine Learning Models
 I did this project as a Capstone project while I was in BrainStation data science bootcamp.
 In this project, I applied logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network algorithms to assess the risk associated with loan requests.
 By analyzing historical loan data and relevant features, I successfully built a predictive model that calculates the probability of a potential defaulter according to their loan application.
